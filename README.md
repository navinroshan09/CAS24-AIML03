ABSTRACT:
This project performs Twitter Sentiment Analysis using an existing CSV file of tweets, classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. It is built with Flask for the backend and a user-friendly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interface. The uploaded CSV file is processed, and sentiment classification is performed using pre-trained models. The results are displayed with sentiment distribution percentages and graphical visualizations using Matplotlib/Plotly.

This tool enables businesses and researchers to analyze public sentiment trends effectively. The system provides a simple and interactive way to upload datasets and visualize sentiment analysis results, making it a useful solution for social media analytics and brand monitoring.
